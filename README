Snuggle is a newcomer observation and support system for MediaWiki communities 
(like Wikipedia) originally developed by Aaron Halfaker 
(aaron.halfaker@gmail.com) as part of his dissertation research.  Snuggle is 
designed to allow experienced wiki mentors to observe the activities of newly 
registered editors and separate desirable newcomers (good-faith & productive) 
from the undesirables (bad-faith & vandals).

The system has two major components:
 - synchronizer:
   Keeps Snuggle's data model in sync with a MediaWiki installation
 - web user interface:
   Provides a visualization of newcomer activities and supports actions that 
   affect the wiki.

These components manifest as server processes that can be started independently
via binaries provided in the base directory.  There's three relevant configuration
files you'll need to provide the scripts at start-up:
 - the snuggle configuration (see config/example.snuggle.yaml):
   This configuration file describes the behavior of Snuggle components
 - the MediaWiki configuration (see config/enwiki.medaiwiki.yaml):
   This configuration file describes important characteristics of the MediaWiki
   installation that Snuggle is running against.
 - the language configureation file (see config/english.language.yaml):
   This configuration file describes the language to be used in the user 
   interface.  

Example synchronizer startup:

	% ./syncd config/snuggle.yaml config/mediawiki.yaml


Example web user interface startup

	% ./webd config/snuggle.yaml config/mediawiki.yaml config/language.yaml
