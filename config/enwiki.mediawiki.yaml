protocol: https

# The base domain for the MediaWiki installation.
domain: en.wikipedia.org

# The path to wiki pages and scripts on the server.  This is used for making API

    User-Agent: "Snuggle system (see [[WP:Snuggle]])"

# String to append at the end of comments for all page edit actions performed.

# Thread traces are how socially relevant actions are recorded.  Historically,
# the traces of actions relevant to a user and their behavior in Wikipedia have
# been captured on their talk page.  This section specifies a set of traces that 
# Snuggle will identify and present in the intergace.  Each "trace" specifies a 
# regular expression intended to match the pattern of text that identifies a 
# wiki trace.  Each section of a user's talk page (delimited
# by level 2 headers) will be processed and at most one thread trace can be
# discovered based on the priority.  Priority is determined by order.  Traces 
# that appear first will be prioritized before other traces that could 
# potentially match.
#
# priority: A list of the keys used below sorted by priority
# traces: A map of (key->trace_definition) pairs that describe traces and presentation.
#   expression: a regular expression to be used to check if the thread matches
#               the thread type.  In most cases, this is looking for something 
#               of the form "<!-- Template:... -->"
#   groups: for each group in the regular expression, the icon can be modified.
#           Current the only supported operation is to add a superscript.
#   icon:
#     display: Text to include within the icon
#     superscript: (optional) text to include in a superscript of the icon
#     tooltip: A tooltip that will appear when a user hovers over the trace's 
#              icon in the user interface.
#     style: css based coloring information to be applied to the icon.  Use this
#            to convey information about the meaning of the trace.  
#            e.g. warnings are black and red and welcomes are green and blue.

# User actions represent actions that can be performed on wiki from Snuggle.  
# A good example of a common action is to post a message on the user's talk 
# page.  The order in which they are listed will determine how they appear in
# the user interface.
#
#display: Specifies which actions to display in the user interface.  Removing a
#         an action name from this list will effectively disable the action.

#                action will be taken.  Can contain wiki links and references 
#                to the user.
#   summary: this is used to represent the action taken when presenting the 
#            log of user actions performed.  Use %(user)s and %(snuggler)s to 
#            depict where each actor should be referenced.
#   fields: specifies the components of the form that will be presented in 
#          the UI.
